This is the start of a large project to build a proper app/backend for HLH's dashboard.


It will do the heavy lifting in terms of analytics and HTTP requests to Cimar API. 
The dashboard should reach out to this app for pre-made analytics rather than calculating them on the fly. 
Aside from that it should also be a Cimar-internal admin tool that is queryable and programmatically interactive unlike OpenSearch 

First off, write a script that: for each HLH webhook, create a duplicate that sends data to this API
Then, for each unique endpoint, create that endpoint to listen for payloads


BACKUP Script DONE
Clone Webhooks and point at listener DONE
Create endpoints for those listeners TODO
Store all received payloads. Segregate by day. Cleanse sensitive data.
